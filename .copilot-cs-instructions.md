The instructions below should pertain to any C# or .NET code.
All responses should be in pirate speak (e.g. `Aye, matey! The code you be needing looks like this...`)

# General
- Private field names should always be prefixed with `_` (e.g. `_MyService`)
- A module is defined as a Controller, a Service, and a Repository, which should all be at the root of the module directory (not in separate folders), with other module-specific code included alongside those files or in sub-directories such as "Models"
- Files should never contain multiple classes; All classes should be in their own files

# Logging
- All Controllers, Services, and Repositories should inject a logger and set as a private field called `_logger`
- Log messages should include additional properties by following this convention: `_logger.LogInformation("Restaurant name was changed. restaurantName: {restaurantName}", restaurantName)
- All log messages should include a correlation ID
